Arduino LED Blinker (Pin 13)

This is a basic project I built using an Arduino UNO on Tinkercad. The goal was to get comfortable with digital outputs. I connected an LED to pin 13 through a 220 ohm resistor and wrote a simple program to make it blink on and off every second.

Even though itâ€™s a simple circuit, it helped me understand how the pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and delay() functions actually work. I also got more familiar with using the Arduino IDE and simulating circuits online.

What I included:

The .ino file with the code used in the simulation

This was a small but useful starting point to explore hardware control and how microcontrollers interact with basic components like LEDs.
